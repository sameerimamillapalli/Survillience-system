# Survillience-system

Survillence-System is a part of my course project which detects students in the campus , labs for security reasons. The projet is done using opencv popular image  processing tool.The project has following categories

1) Dataset of images
2) Encodings of images
3) Output folder for video of day

Initially the camera adds faces with the add_faces.py program and stores in the dataset and therby encodings are generated for all the images . The recognize_video recognizes students in the video file under continous monitoring and stores the name as well as time.
The name and time and date gets store in the database of sqlstudio hence maintaining record of students working in lab. The project is under development and the UI of the project is yet to start so as to convert into an application.
All the codes are commented and are self explanatory.
